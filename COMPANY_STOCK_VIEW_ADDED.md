# Company Stock View Feature - ADDED! ‚úÖ

## What Was Missing
The original Stock Manager application had a "Company Stock View" feature that provided a comprehensive overview of all products for the selected company in a tabular format. This was missing from the initial refactored version.

## What I Added

### 1. **CompanyStockViewUI Component** (`ui/company_stock_view.py`)
- Complete implementation of the company stock overview table
- Shows aggregated data by product ID with:
  - Product ID and Name
  - Live cartons and pieces count
  - Damaged/expired units
  - Earliest inwarded and expiry dates
  - Last outwarded date
  - Average MRP per piece
  - Storage locations
  - Stock status (In Stock, Out of Stock, All Expired, Some Damaged/Expired)

### 2. **Dashboard Integration**
- Added "View [Company Name] Stock Details" button to the dashboard
- Button dynamically shows current company name
- Clicking the button opens the Company Stock View tab

### 3. **Dynamic Tab Management**
- Company Stock View tab is created on-demand when first accessed
- Tab title updates when switching companies
- Data refreshes automatically when company changes

### 4. **Data Aggregation Logic**
- Groups all cartons by product ID
- Calculates totals for live stock, damaged units, expired units
- Tracks earliest inward dates and expiry dates
- Determines stock status based on multiple factors
- Handles multiple locations per product

## How to Access

1. **From Dashboard**: Click the "View [Company Name] Stock Details" button
2. **Navigation**: Use "‚Üê Back to Dashboard" button to return
3. **Data Refresh**: Click "Refresh Data" button to update the view
